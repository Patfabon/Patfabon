            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I’m Patrick C. Fabon, a dedicated and detail-oriented virtual assistant passionate about helping businesses streamline their workflows and stay organized. My mission is to provide reliable and efficient support that allows my clients to focus on growing their business. I’m proficient in Microsoft Office, Google Workspace, and other tools, and I’m always eager to learn new software to support my clients better. With a strong background in data entry and administrative support, I specialize in handling the day-to-day tasks that keep businesses running smoothly. I’m passionate about helping entrepreneurs and businesses find balance by taking over tasks that can free up their time. My goal is to be the right-hand support my clients can trust to handle both routine and complex tasks with confidence and efficiency. When I’m not working, I enjoy playing volleyball, reading about productivity hacks, and going on nature walks that refresh my mind and help me stay focused and motivated</p>
